# Strategy Diagnostics

Purpose:
This repository will host the delivery layer for Catalyst’s Strategy Diagnostics.

Non-goals:
- No strategy logic defined here
- No scoring rules defined here
- No AI judgment defined here

Architecture assumptions:
- Canonical definitions live in Notion
- Scoring logic is proven externally before being ported
- This layer renders, gates, and distributes outputs only

Status:
Pre-implementation. Logic stabilization in progress.
